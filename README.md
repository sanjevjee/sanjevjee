#### [ReneWind](https://olympus.mygreatlearning.com/feed/sanjeev-kumar31/57b16c5c5b55545e414b31e17093aefeebbcda73)
Excellent learning experience completing this project as part of the Model Tuning course in the PGP-BABI-INTL program at Great Learning.
"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.

Excellent learning experience completing this project as part of the Business Statistics course in the PGP-BABI-INTL program at Great Learning.
This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.

Excellent learning experience completing this project as part of the Python - Foundations course in the PGP-BABI-INTL program at Great Learning.
The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to draw some actionable insights for the business. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.
